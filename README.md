# AI-Powered Writing Coach

This repository contains code for a portion of an AI-powered writing coach application
developed by Utah State University's Center for Instructional Design & Innovation
and Teaching & Learning Technologies office.

This section of the application focuses on editing, proofreading, and revising and
was written by Emma Lynn (e.lynn@usu.edu), supervised by Ludovic Attiogbe and Neal Legler.

* Frontend was written in Javascript with React (using Redux for state management)
* Backend was written in PHP as a XAMPP web server
  * Created from an LTI template written by Ludovic Attiogbe

## Usage
* Set up XAMPP on your local machine
* Move the code in the server directory into `XAMPP/htdocs`
* Open the XAMPP manager-os
* Start the MySQL Database
* Start the Apache Web Server
* In the projectâ€™s root directory run:
  * `cd client`
  * `npm install`
  * `npm start`

This code is no longer current because active development has moved to different shared repositories.
